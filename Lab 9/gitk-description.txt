In the top left corner is the branches and merges showing the general structure of the
commits.

In the top middle window is the author of the commit.

In the top right window is the date of the commit.

In the middle between the top and bottom windows is a sort of search directory containing
the ID of the commit, the row, and two search bars, one to find commits, another to find 
words or pharses in the commit.

In the bottom left is a window that displays the commit along with options for diff, new
version, and old version.

In the bottom right is a window for comments, along with options for patch or tree.
