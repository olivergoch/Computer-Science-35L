$cd diffutils-3.0
-I moved into the unpatched diffutils folder

$git checkout v3.0 -b quote
-This checkouted the 3.0 version into a new branch named quote

$cp ../diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt
-I copied the patch file into current directory

$patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
-I applied the patch to the current file

$emacs
-I entered the emacs editor

C-x 4 a
-I made a Changelog of all the files

$git add .
$git commit -F ChangeLog
-I committed the changes and used the ChangeLog as the commit message

$git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
-I created the patch with the changes

My partner for this project was David Macaraeg. I scped his patch from his server and 
put it in mine, renaming it DavidPatch.txt

$cp -r ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils PartnerDiffutils
-I made a new diffutils folder for the partner section

$git checkout v3.0 -b partner
-I switched to a new branch, naming it partner.

$git am < DavidPatch.txt
-I ran his patch on the file, correcting the grave apostrophe errors.

$./bootstrap
$./configure
$make
$make check
-I ran all of this with my partner’s patch, and it all worked perfectly

$./make distdir
-This created the directory diffutils-3.0.1-2da3. I checked the ChangeLog within that file
and it looked as expected. 

I also worked with Benji Brandt, and his patch worked correctly as well, repeating all the
previous steps

$cp -r ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs egg
-I tried copying these files into a folder called egg, but unfortunately many of them were 
not able to be copied

$git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git egg
-So I then cloned the repository into a folder called egg

$gitk
-This didn’t work

$ssh -X oliver@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
-I realized the gitk command didn’t work because I needed to ssh onto the linux with the 
-X option, which would allow X11 forwarding

$gitk
-This command now worked and X11 started running on my computer
