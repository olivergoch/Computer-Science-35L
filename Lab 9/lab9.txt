$export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
-I made sure the path was correct so I could use git properly

$cp -r ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils .
-I copied the required diffutils library to the current directory

$cd diffutils
-I changed the working directory to be diffutils

$git log > git-log.txt
-I got the log of changes and put it in the file git-log.txt

$git tag > git-tags.txt
-I got the list of tags and put it in the file git-tag.txt

$vi git-log.txt
-I found the number for the commit entitled maint: quote ‘like this’ or “like this”, not
`like this’

$git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt
-I got the required git commit and put it in the file quote-patch.txt

$git checkout v3.0
-I used the checkout to to check out version 3.0 of Diffutils

$patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
-I applied the patch to the version 3.0 of the system. I skipped past choosing which file
to patch when necessary, and I ran into no problems. I was in the diffutils folder so that
is why I used -p1

$git status
-I used git status to see all the changes, and which files were changed:
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   NEWS
#	modified:   README
#	modified:   TODO
#	modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
#	modified:   ms/config.bat
#	modified:   ms/config.site
#	modified:   po/en.po
#	modified:   src/analyze.c
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/context.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff.h
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/ifdef.c
#	modified:   src/io.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/side.c
#	modified:   src/system.h
#	modified:   src/util.c
#	modified:   tests/help-version

$emacs
-I entered Emacs

C-x C-f NEWS
-I found the NEWS file, which is not a .c file

C-x v =
-I entered the *vc-diff* buffer for NEWS

C-x v u
-I reverted all the changes to NEWS, as per the spec.

I will do the same thing to all not .c files

Finished analyze.c & context.c

Next I edited the .c files, undoing all changes to character string constants, also called
comments, and leaving the changes to character strings.

C-u C-c C-a
-This unapplied a hunk of the patch

Then I analyzed the *.c.rej files, of which there were 2, diff.c.rej, diff3.c.rej.

M-s w
-I saw that the line lines in the in .c.rej files did not always correlate to the lines
in the .c files, so I used word search, and then I made the necessary edits.

$git clean -f
-This gets rid of all the untracked files

$git status
-This gives all the tracked files:
# HEAD detached at v3.0
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c
#

$git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
-This created a patch with all the remaining differences

I logged out and logged back in on the lnxsrv01 so I would not have to apply the patch
$./bootstrap
$./configure
$./make
$./make check
-I ran the commands in README-hacking to fix the diff commmand

$diff . -
$diff —-help
-These commands outputted the correct output

$cp -r diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch
$git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils-3.0
-These created the directories of the patched and source files

$diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt
-This created the txt file with all the differences

$diff quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils-3.0-patch/quote-3.0-patch.txt 
-This outputted all the differences in the two txt files, which turned out to be 
innoucous as they are the changes that were made to fix the bug.
