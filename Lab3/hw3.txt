1. The line was not necessary to remove, but it was cleaning up messy code.

2. The difference in representation of the date between domestic and foreign 
coders can be one difficulty. Another would be the lack of a timestamp in the 
patched version.

3. When we run randline on an empty file we get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 49, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 43, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 13, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/
  python2.7/random.py", line 275, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq 
    is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This basically happens because the script searches for something, but nothing
is there, so an indexing error happens.

4. Running randline with Python3 gives us the error:
File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Because it is a tuple, and tuples were done away with in Python3.
